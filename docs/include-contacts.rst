join the `rtorrent-community`_ on Gitter.

This is also the way to resolve any problems with or questions about your configuration
and software installation. In case of trouble, prepare enough information about
your machine and configuration beforehand, so that people can actually help you.
ESR's golden oldie `How To Ask Questions The Smart Way`_ is still a most valuable resource here.
